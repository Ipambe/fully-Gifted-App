# Fully Gifted App

### I am building a GIF search and download app called Fully Gifted. This project will help me to practice:
- **React**: Building a front-end application using React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the app using Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the app looks great on all devices.
- **APIs**: Fetching data from an external API to display GIFs.
- **Blob**: Downloading GIFs as Blob objects to save them to the user's device.

### By the time I complete this project, these are the features I hope to have implemented:

- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for GIFs using keywords or phrases to find the perfect animation for any situation.
- **Download GIFs**: Download your favorite GIFs directly to your device for later use, even when offline.
- **Categories**: Browse through various categories to discover trending GIFs or explore new themes.
- **Favorites**: Save your most-loved GIFs to a favorites list for quick access.

### I will be using the GIPHY API to fetch GIFs for this project. You can find more information about the GIPHY API [here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide).
